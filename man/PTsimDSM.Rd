\title{Plausibility Transform for Combined Simple Dempster-Shafer Models (simDSM)}
\usage{
PTsimDSM(x, y, a, y0 = 0, flip = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A binary matrix where each row represents a focal element that is not the full SSR.}

\item{y}{A logical column matrix indicating which rows of \code{x} may need inversion.}

\item{a}{A numeric value (0 ≤ \code{a} ≤ 1) representing the mass assigned to each nontrivial focal element.}

\item{y0}{A reference value (default = 0 or \code{FALSE}) used to determine which rows of \code{x} are inverted.}

\item{flip}{Logical; whether to perform row inversion where applicable (default = \code{TRUE}).}
}
\value{
A numeric plausibility vector \code{plau}.
}
\description{
Performs the plausibility transform on the combination of multiple simple Dempster-Shafer models (simDSMs) defined over a large state-space representation (SSR).
}
\details{
This function handles the case where several simple Dempster-Shafer models are combined on a very large SSR.  
Each row of the binary matrix \code{x} represents a focal element from one simDSM that is *not* the entire SSR.  
These focal elements can be specified directly or as complements, depending on which is more efficient to encode.  
A logical column matrix \code{y} identifies which rows of \code{x} need to be inverted (using the value \code{y0} as the check).

\examples{
# Example usage:
x <- matrix(c(1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
y <- matrix(c(TRUE, FALSE))
PTsimDSM(x, y, a = 0.3)
