\description{
This dataset is the \code{tt} matrix establishing a relation between S, W and R, where S = {0:3}, W = {foul, fair} and R = {true, false}. The goal of this relation is to account for other causes of sailing delay. All the elements (s,w,r) of (S x W x R) where W or R is true add one day of sailing delay. We put a mass value of 0.9 to this subset. The remaining mass of 0.1 is allotted to the frame.
}
\details{
To construct the \code{tt} matrix, we put the variables S, W, R side by side, as in a truth table representation. Each triplet of the subset is described by a row of the matrix as a vector of zeros and ones.
