\description{
This dataset is the \code{tt} matrix establishing the relation between the four variables. Each event (loading = true, forecast = foul, Maintenance = true) adds one day of Departure Delay. The elements (d,l, f, m) of (D x L x F x M) satisfying the relation form a subset with a mass value of 1. To construct the \code{tt} matrix, we put the variables D,L,F,M side by side, as in a truth table representation. Each 4-tuple of the subset is described by a row of the matrix as a vector of zeros and ones.
