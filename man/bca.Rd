\arguments{
\item{tt}{Mandatory. A (0,1)-matrix or a boolean matrix. The number of columns must match the number of elements (values) of the frame of discernment \eqn{\Theta}. Each row is a subset of \eqn{\Theta}. The last row is the frame \eqn{\Theta}, represented by a vector of 1's.}

\item{m}{A numeric vector of length equal to the number of rows of the matrix  \code{tt}. Values of \code{m} must lie in the interval \code{(0,1]} and must add to one. The mass \code{m(k)} represents the chance value allotted to the proposition represented by the row \code{k} of the matrix \code{tt}.}

\item{cnames}{A character vector containing the names of the elements of the frame of discernment \eqn{\Theta}. The length must be equal to the number of elements of \eqn{\Theta}. The names are first searched in the \code{valuenames} parameter. If NULL, column names of the matrix \code{tt} are taken if present. Otherwise, names are generated.}

\item{con}{The measure of conflict can be provided. 0 by default.}

\item{ssnames}{A list of subsets names which will be obtained from the column names of the tt matrix.}

\item{idvar}{The number given to the variable. A number is necessary to manage relations between variables  and make computations on a graph. 0 if omitted.}

\item{infovar}{A two-column matrix containing variable identification numbers and the number of elements of the variable. Generated if omitted.}

\item{varnames}{The name of the variable. Generated if omitted.}

\item{valuenames}{A list of the names of the variables with the name of the elements of their frame of discernment.}

\item{inforel}{Not used here. Defined within function \code{\link{bcaRel}}.}
}
\value{
y An object of class \code{bcaspec} called a bca for "basic chance assignment": \itemize{
  \item tt  The table of focal elements. Rownames of the matrix of focal elements are generated from the column names of the elements of the frame. See \code{\link{nameRows}} for details.
  \item spec  A two column matrix. First column contains numbers given to the subsets, 1 to  \code{nrow(tt)}. Second column contains the mass values of the subsets. 
  \item con  The measure of conflict.
  \item infovar  The number of the variable and the size of the frame of discernment.
  \item varnames  The name of the variable.
  \item valuenames  A list of length 1 consisting of the name of the variable with the names of the elements of the frame of discernment (the column names of the \code{tt} matrix).
  \item ssnames A list of subsets names done from the column names of the tt matrix.
  \item inforel  Set at 0. used in function \code{\link{bcaRel}}.

\description{
Function \code{bca} is used to define subsets of a finite set \eqn{\Theta} of possible values and to assign their corresponding mass value.\cr
The set \eqn{\Theta} is called the frame of discernment. Each subset \eqn{A} of  \eqn{Theta} with a positive mass value is called a focal element or a proposition. The associated mass value is a number of the \code{(0,1]} interval, called "basic chance assignment" (the basic probability assignment of Shafer's book). All other subsets that have not received a positive mass value are assumed to have a mass value of zero.
}
\details{
There is two ways of defining the bca: a (0,1) matrix or a list of subsets labels.
