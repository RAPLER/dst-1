\title{Simple printing of the \code{tt} matrix and mass values of a Dempster-Shafer Model}
\usage{
DSMprint(x, remove = FALSE)

bcaPrint(x, remove = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A list of class bcaspec.}

\item{remove}{Default = FALSE. Put = TRUE to exclude subsets with zero mass.}
}
\value{
A table of subsets with their associated mass. Subsets are identified by row names.
}
\description{
This utility function does a simple printing of a DSM  (basic chance assignment).
}
\examples{
z <- bca(tt = matrix(c(0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1),nrow = 3, 
byrow = TRUE), m = c(0.2,0.5, 0.3),
