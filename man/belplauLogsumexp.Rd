\title{Calculation of the degrees of Belief and Plausibility of a basic chance assignment (bca) with logsumexp.}
\usage{
belplauLogsumexp(x, remove = FALSE, h = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A basic chance assignment mass function (see \code{\link{bca}}).}

\item{remove}{= TRUE: Exclude subsets with zero mass.}

\item{h}{= NULL: Hypothesis to be tested. Description matrix in the same format than \code{x$tt}}
}
\value{
A matrix of \code{M} rows by 3 columns is returned, where \code{M} is the number of focal elements: \itemize{
 \item Column 1: the degree of Belief \code{bel};
 \item Column 2: the degree of Disbellief (belief in favor of the contrary hypothesis) \code{disbel};
 \item Column 3: the degree of Epistemic uncertainty \code{unc};
 \item Column 4: the degree of Plausibility \code{plau};
 \item Column 5: the Plausibility ratio \code{rplau}.
   }
}
\description{
Degrees of Belief \code{Bel} and Plausibility \code{Pl} of the focal elements of a bca are computed. The ratio of the plausibility of a focal element against the plausibility of its contrary is also computed. Subsets with zero mass can be excluded from the calculations.\cr
}
\details{
The degree of belief \code{Bel} is defined by: \cr
\deqn{bel(A) = Sum((m(B); B \subseteq A))}{bel(A) = Sum((m(B); B <= A))} for every subset B of A.\cr
The degree of plausibility \code{pl} is defined by: \cr
\deqn{pl(A) = Sum[(m(B); B \cap A \neq \emptyset]}{pl(A) = Sum[(m(B); (B & A) not empty]} for every subset \code{B} of the frame of discernment. \cr
The plausibility ratio of a focal element \code{A} versus its contrary \code{not A} is defined by:  \eqn{Pl(A)/(1-Bel(A))}.
