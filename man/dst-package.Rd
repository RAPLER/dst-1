\title{Manipulation and combination of belief functions}
\description{
Package dst allows you to make basic probability assignments on subsets of a set of possibilities (events) and combine these events with Dempster's rule of combination.
}
\details{
The main operations that can be done are: \itemize{
\item definition of a basic chance assignment (bca) distribution on a variable,
 \item combination of two bca's defined on the same variable,
 \item definition of a bca which establish a relation between two or more variables,
 \item extension of a bca,
 \item marginalization of a bca. 
 }
