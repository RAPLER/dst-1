\title{Reduction of a relation}
\usage{
dproj(rel, xnb)

elim(rel, xnb)
}
\arguments{
\item{rel}{The relation to reduce, an object of class bcaspec.}

\item{xnb}{Identification number of the variable to eliminate.}
}
\value{
r The reduced relation
}
\description{
This function works on a relation defined on a product of two variables or more.  Having fixed a variable to eliminate from the relation,  the reduced product space is determined and the corresponding reduced bca is computed.This operation is also called "marginalization".
}
\examples{
 
# We construct a relation between two variables to show marginalization.
