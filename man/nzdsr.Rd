\title{Normalization of a basic chance assignment}
\usage{
nzdsr(x, sparse = "no")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A basic chance assignment, i.e. a object of class bcaspec.}

\item{sparse}{Put "yes" to use sparse matrix. Default = "no".}
}
\value{
z The normalized basic chance assignment.
}
\description{
It may occur that the result of the combination of two basic chance assignments with Dempster's Rule of combination contains a non-zero mass allocated to the empty set. The function \code{nzdsr} normalizes the result of function \code{dsrwon} by dividing the mass value of the non-empty subsets by 1 minus the mass of the empty set.
