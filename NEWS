dst 1.5.1.9011

Changes to function dsrwon 
- Parameter sparseM removed. Not necessary to specify this. Replaced byy parametter use_ssnames.

- New parameter: use_ssnames = c(TRUE, FALSE). Default = FALSE. use "TRUE" when you want to work specifically with subsets names to do the intersections. Work only with the univariate frame of discernment. Does'nt work yet with product spaces.

- New parameter: skpt_tt = c(FALSE, TRUE). Default = FALSE". Choose TRUE if you don't want to save this table. Useful if you apply the function repeatedly, and you want to save the last result only.

Function bca.
- Parameter ssnames added.
- test for duplicate column names added

dst 1.5.1.9008

Temporarily removed the possibility of using subsets label (parameter ssnames) instead of a description matrix (parameter tt). This possibility will retested later.
_________________
dst 1.5.1.9007

addTobca: A parameter "status" has been added to the "spec" of the bca in order to distinguish the new subsets added from the ones already present (documentation to be updated with an example).

bca: parametetrs ssnames and sfod removed. It is not necessary to supply subsets names. They are obtained from the columns names of tt (0,1) matrix. See the new function "ssnames" designed for that.

dsrwon: correction to call to dst package for parallel processing.

nameRows: Allow sparse matrix as input. Removed stopping the function if there is no column names.Generate column names instead.

nzdsr: 
A call to function "dsrwon" has been removed to speed up the function. If the empty set is in first position in the matrix of subsets, as it should be, the normalization wil be done correctly.

Removed the test with the conflict indice. This test would stop the function. The conflict indice does not play a role in the combination by Dempster's rule. This is only a decision aid in the analysis of conflicting evidence

Added the possibility of using subsets label (parameter ssnames) instead of a description matrix (parameter tt).
-------------
dst 1.5.1.9006

ssnames: New function. Construct subsets names from the columns names of tt matrix. Subsets names will be used to do intersections instead of (0,1) matrices.

dsrwon. New version allowing the use of sparse matrices. use of subset names to do intetrsections.

dotprod, inters nameRows. Update of functions to allow the use of sparse matrices

================
dst v1.0.0 (Release date on CRAN: 2018-04-25)

Changes from version 0.3:
- Added a vignette: The Monty hall Game, an introduction to belief functions.

- functions (new and updated):

-- addTobca: New function. Adds some elements of 0 mass to an existing mass function.

-- bca: New version. Sets a class named "bcaspec". Parameters added to work with definitions on product spaces (relations).

-- bcaRel: New function to define a belief function on a product space.

-- belplau: Calculation of measures of belief, plausibility and ratio of plausibility.

-- decode: utility function
-- dotprod: utility function
-- double: utility function
-- shape: utility function
-- encode: New utility function. Convert a value to its representation in another chosen base.
-- reduction: utility function to obtain the summary of a vector for any operator

-- dsrwon: Combination of two mass functions

-- elim: This is a new function. This function works on a relation defined on a product of two variables or more.  Having fixed a variable to eliminate from the relation,  the reduced product space is determined and the corresponding reduced bca is computed.This operation is also called "marginalization".

-- extmin: Extension of a relation to a greater product space

-- inters: Intersection of two tables of propositions

-- nameRows: New function: Using the column names of a matrix to construct names for the rows

-- nzdsr: Normalization of results from Dempster's rule of combination.

-- productSpace: New function. Product space representation of a relation

-- plautrans:Plausibility transformation of the singletons of a frame

-- tabresul:  Prepare a table of results.
